# earthbound-lsmp

This repo contains the code for [this lobby](https://bloxd.io/play/classic/earthbound-lsmp%E2%9D%A4)

## Things currently in this code

- Day/night cycle
- Zombies spawning at night
- Hardcore mode but you get tempbanned instead of permabanned

## Things that I want to add in the future

- More diverse mob spawning
- Special events (i.e. blood moon, supernova)
- Rtp when repspawn to avoid spawn protection
- Mobs that die during daytime
